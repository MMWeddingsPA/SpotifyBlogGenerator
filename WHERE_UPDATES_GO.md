# Where Your Updates Are Going - Visual Guide

## The Current Situation

```
Your App Updates → WordPress 'content' field → ✅ Saved but not visible
                                              ↓
                                    Elementor ignores this field
                                              ↓  
Frontend Shows → Elementor '_elementor_data' → ❌ Not updated (yet)
```

## What's Actually Happening

### 1. **Your updates ARE working**, but going to the wrong place:

```
WordPress Post Structure:
├── title: "Your Post Title" 
├── content: "YOUR UPDATES GO HERE" ← This is being updated
├── status: "draft"
└── meta:
    └── _elementor_data: "{...}" ← This is what Elementor shows (NOT updated)
```

### 2. **How to verify your updates are saved:**

1. Go to WordPress Admin → Posts → All Posts
2. Find your post and click **"Edit"** (NOT "Edit with Elementor")
3. Look at the editor content - you'll see your updates there!

### 3. **Why you don't see them on the frontend:**

When Elementor is active on a post, it:
- ❌ Ignores the WordPress `content` field completely
- ✅ Renders only from `_elementor_data` meta field
- Your updates are in the wrong container!

## Elementor Structure Explained

Elementor stores its content as nested JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123",
    "elType": "section",
    "elements": [
      {
        "id": "def456", 
        "elType": "column",
        "elements": [
          {
            "id": "ghi789",
            "elType": "widget",
            "widgetType": "text-editor",  ← This is where text goes
            "settings": {
              "editor": "<p>Blog content here</p>"  ← THIS needs updating
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Which Elementor Widgets Get Updated?

The app will update these widget types:

### 1. **Text Editor Widget** (`text-editor`)
- Most common for blog content
- Rich text with formatting
- Located in: `settings.editor`

### 2. **Heading Widget** (`heading`)
- For titles and headers
- Located in: `settings.title`

### 3. **Theme Post Content** (`theme-post-content`)
- Dynamic content widget
- Auto-pulls from post content
- May not need updating if configured right

### 4. **Basic Text Widget** (`text`)
- Simple text without formatting
- Located in: `settings.text`

## Quick Test Without PHP Changes

Want to see if updates work? Try this:

1. **Create a test post WITHOUT Elementor**:
   - WordPress Admin → Posts → Add New
   - Write some content in the regular editor
   - Publish it
   - Try updating with your app
   - Updates should be visible immediately!

2. **Check if a post uses Elementor**:
   - Edit the post
   - If you see "Edit with Elementor" button = Uses Elementor
   - If you see regular WordPress editor = Doesn't use Elementor

3. **Temporarily disable Elementor for one post**:
   - Edit post in WordPress (not Elementor)
   - In the sidebar, look for "Elementor" panel
   - There might be an option to disable Elementor for this post

## The Solution Path

```
Current:
App → REST API → WordPress content field → Not visible with Elementor

After PHP fix:
App → REST API → Elementor data → Updates specific widgets → Visible!
```

## Bottom Line

- ✅ Your updates ARE being saved to WordPress
- ❌ They're just not visible because Elementor uses different data
- 🔧 The PHP file enables updating the right Elementor data
- 📝 Without the PHP file, updates only work on non-Elementor posts
